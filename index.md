title: Lingua Latina
---

The `Lingua Latina` organization is developing a new approach to teaching Latin based on contemporary research in pedagogy and linguistics.

Some repositories we are currently beginning to develop:

- textbook and reference materials for an introductory course in Latin, comparable to a first-year course at the college/university level
- course material from semester- and year-long courses in Latin preparing students to read unaltered Latin texts
- citable digital corpora with accompanying morphological analysis
- scripts and tools supporting analysis of a corpus to design courses on modern pedagogical principles
